    When running ls notfolder.
    It failed with exit code 1.
    The error message was: 'ls: cannot access ''inexistant_folder'': No such file or directory'.
    Help me fix it.

    You should verify if inexistant_folder exist and is a folder
    If it isn't you can fix this by using mkdir inexistant_folder and execute ls notfolder
